Simple RuneScape Account Creator.
Official thread link: https://osbot.org/forum/topic/146443-account-creator-alpha/

## Dependencies
Dependencies are in the "libs" folder. These are necessary for the jar to be compiled. This uses Anti-Captcha (http://getcaptchasolution.com/espcjise9v) to solve captchas. Please register an account to get an API key.

## How to use?
Double click the .jar file you can download from the release section (Or build it yourself).
Logger is now included in the program, but if you want to be 100% sure to receive logs, please run the program from the command line.
To do this, open cmd/terminal, and type ```java -jar path/to/file.jar```. Program will log to the newest logger instance.

## Username Feature
The "custom usernames" feature will take two word lists as a prefix and suffix for your new account's name. The lists should each have one word per line.

Usernames are generated by grabbing a random line from each file, combining them, and adding a number between 100 and 999.

If the generated username is shorter than 9 characters, the numbers will be added to the end of the name.

If the generated username is longer than 9 characters, the numbers will be added between the prefix and suffix and the final name will be trimmed to 12 characters.

# Not the best creator ever, but it works most of the time
# I'm not responsible if you "waste" all your anti-captcha credits on this
